# CollapsibleTableReact
An app that reads a json file and outputs the data in the form of an expansible table.  
This is a tas I did for my internship application to SIM Advisory.  
The json file being read is stored in the src folder, so if anyone wishes to test a new file without altering the code, please make sure to save the new file in the same folder as "data.json".
